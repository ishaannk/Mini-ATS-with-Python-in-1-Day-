# Resume Filter CLI 
I built a Resume Filter Application using Python + Pandas!

 This mini-project can instantly find candidates based on any skill entered.

▶️ User types a skill (example: "Python", "FastAPI").

▶️ App instantly searches and lists all matching candidates.

▶️ Option to search again without restarting!
